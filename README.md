# Data Mining labs

This repository contains the work done in our data mining labs in which we ran through : 
    
    - Supervised learning : Analyze the dataSet, execute naive bayes algorithm and evaluate its performance.
    
    - Unsupervised learning : k-means algorithm, CAH and divisive clustering.
